Example/test bed for JAMinecraftGridView.

This application can read and write schematic and rdat files, and display them
as a grid, one layer at a time. The grid shows solid blocks as, er, solid
blocks, transparent blocks as outlines and items as inset squares. The block
types are colour-coded. Blocks with tile entities have dotted orange outlines.

The rendering and scaling is implemented in JASchematicViewerView.m, a
subclass of JAMinecraftGridView. All other interaction, including selection
and scrolling, is handled by JAMinecraftGridView.
