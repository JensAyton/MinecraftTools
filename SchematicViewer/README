Example/test bed for JAMinecraftGridView.

This application can read and write schematic and rdat file, and display them
as a grid, one layer at a time. The grid shows solid blocks as, er, solid
blocks, quasi-solid blocs as outlines and items as inset sqares. The block
types are colour coded.

The rendering and scaling is implemented in JASchematicViewerView.m, a
subclass of JAMinecraftGridView. All other interaction, including selection
and scrolling, are handled by JAMinecraftGridView.
