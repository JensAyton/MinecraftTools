MinecraftKit

A proto-framework for working with Minecraft data.

JAMinecraftBlockIDs.h and JAMinecraftBlockIDs.c are plain C and should work
from C++. The rest is bleeding-edge Objective-C â€“ it requires Apple-Clang 1.5,
Snow Leopard, x86_64 and garbage collection.

Debug facilities are controlled by the NDEBUG macro: define it for faster
code. It is assumed that if NDEBUG is defined, NS_BLOCK_ASSERTIONS will also
be defined.
