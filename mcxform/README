mcxform

Command-line tool to manipulate Minecraft schematics, primarily intended for
redstone construction.

IMPORTANT: the current implementation discards entities and tile entities,
making it impractical for general use.

Usage:
mcxform <outputfile> [commands]

<outputfile> is a file name. If it ends in .rdat, a Redstone Simulator rdat
file is written. Otherwise, a schematic file is written.

[commands] is a series of commands from the following list. In theory any
sequence is valid, but starting with anything other than --in is pointless.

--in <filename>: Load <filename> (an rdat or schematic file) at location
                 0, 0, 0. If multiple files are loaded, the newest will
                 overwrite the previous ones, except that air tiles will
                 not be written over non-air tiles.
--move <x y z>:  Move the already-loaded data. X ranges from west to east,
                 y from south to north and z from bottom to top.
--flipx:         Flip the schematic horizontally, from east to west.
--flipy:         Flip the schematic vertically, from north to south.
--rotl:          Rotate the schematic left (anti-clockwise as seen from
                 above) 90°.
--rotr:          Rotate the schematic right (clockwise as seen from above)
                 90°.
--rot180:        Rotate the schematic 180°.
